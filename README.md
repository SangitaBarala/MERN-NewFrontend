# Getting Started with Create React Frontend App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About Project

By following this project readme.md you will be able to create a basic memory card or a card where you are storing your specific happy moment through a Form 

that will ask you to enter:

-Creator name

-Title

-Message(description of your story)

-Tags

-You can choose an image for that memory

-Finally, the SUBMIT and CLEAR button to perform action accordingly


### `npm init -y`
It will start with a fundamental description of project

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

[react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)

[react-confirm alerts](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)

### `Final presentation`
-You can see all the CRUD operations in action where you can craete a card to store your memory or happy moment 

-you can also like it update it by clicing three dots in top-right corner of card 

-and finally can delete it if want

-and fun part it is connected to [Mongoose Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/) database to store the changes altogether.

### `Project Frontend Deployment`
The project frontend is deployed using [AWS(Amazon Web Service)](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Types=*all&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=*all) portal where you can have access to ocean amount of services provided by Amazon.

You can have access to [Project Frontend](https://master.dllyhejvocz7s.amplifyapp.com/)

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
